Clustering

# **Clustering Analysis Project**

## **Overview**
This project performs a **clustering analysis** using machine learning techniques. The main objective is to group data points based on their features into clusters and visualize the results. The analysis includes the following clustering algorithms:
- **K-Means Clustering**: Partition-based clustering that assigns data points to the nearest cluster center.
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)**: Identifies core, boundary, and noise points.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a dendrogram to show the hierarchy of clusters.

## **Problem Statement**
Given a dataset with multiple features, the task is to:
1. Preprocess the data.
2. Apply clustering algorithms to group similar data points.
3. Evaluate the performance of clustering using appropriate metrics.

## **Key Components**
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Standardize or normalize the dataset for better clustering performance.
2. **Clustering Algorithms Implemented:**
   - **K-Means**: Assigns points to clusters by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares.
   - **DBSCAN**: Groups dense clusters and marks outliers.
   - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a dendrogram to visualize clusters at different levels.
3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar a data point is to its cluster compared to other clusters.
   - **Davies-Bouldin Index**: Measures compactness and separation of clusters.

## **Environment Setup**
To run the project, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
